        <h1>Dancing Plague of 1518</h1>
        <h4>The dancing plague of 1518, or dance epidemic of 1518, was a case of dancing mania that occurred in
            Strasbourg, Alsace (modern-day France), in the Holy Roman Empire from July 1518 to September 1518. Somewhere
            between 50 and 400 people took to dancing for days.</h4>
        <h2>Events</h2>
        <p>The outbreak began in July 1518 when a woman began to dance fervently in a street in Strasbourg.[1] By early
            September, the outbreak began to subside.[2]</p>
        <p>Historical documents, including "physician notes, cathedral sermons, local and regional chronicles, and even
            notes issued by the Strasbourg city council" are clear that the victims danced;[1] it is not known why.
            Historical sources agree that there was an outbreak of dancing after a single woman started dancing,[3] a
            group of mostly young women joined in, and the dancing did not seem to die down. It lasted for such a long
            time that it attracted the attention of the Strasbourg magistrate and bishop, and some number of doctors
            ultimately intervened, putting the afflicted in a hospital.[citation needed]</p>

        <h2>Modern theories</h2>
        <h3>Food poisoning</h3>
        <p>Some believe[2] the dancing could have been brought on by food poisoning caused by the toxic and psychoactive
            chemical products of ergot fungi (ergotism), which grows commonly on grains (such as rye) used for baking
            bread. Ergotamine is the main psychoactive product of ergot fungi; it is structurally related to the drug
            lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25) and is the substance from which LSD-25 was originally synthesized. The
            same fungus has also been implicated in other major historical anomalies, including the Salem witch
            trials.[10][11]</p>
